The European transect study assesses clonal oak saplings released across Germany and Europe for analyzing A&A patterns under a wide range of environmental conditions.

On each plot, three cameras are installed, each monitoring a **north facing target branch** on a focal tree. Cameras are installed on a tripod beside the tree.
<span style="color:red">If you need to temporarily move the tripod, e.g. to sample the soil beneath the tripod, please follow the below protocol!</span>.

# Moving a Tripod

*Before actually moving anything, please make sure that the camera itself is securely attached ot the tripod, so it won't fall down when moving the tripod. If the solar panel is installed directly to the tripod, make sure it is securely attached, as well.*

Detach the guy ropes from the tripod. If the solar panel is installed remotely, detach it's cables from the camera, as well. Pick up the tripo an move it to whereever is practical for you and put it back to it's place once you're done. Reattach the guy ropes and any cable you dettached.
<span style="color:red">Please make sure the solar panel isn't covered (too much) by the surrounding canopy.</span>

**Lastly, make sure the camera is correctly capturing the target brach!** [how to align the camera]
